# STAR WARS QUIZ BY KEVIN FUJIMOTO

## CHALLENGES
I felt frustrated many times during this assignment.  In prior assignments, I did very well, got decent grades, and most importantly, understood what I was doing.  However, in this assignment, the situation was quite different.  For the first time in this bootcamp, I felt ill-prepared for this assignment, despite 6-7 additional hours per day, in addition to the 4-hour class time.  I worked 16 hours on the weekend to attempt to finish the assignment, but was unable to complete some functionality requirements.  I am very disheartened by the fact that I invested so much time and energy on this quiz assignment, yet I do not feel as though I have the output that represents that investment.  I found myself utilizing BCS assistants on multiple occasions, along with tutoring sessions, and all TA/Instructor office hours.  I found it difficult to communicate my issues on Slack, rather than speaking with someone on a Zoom call.  I often received code on Slack that would not be applicable to my quiz game in that it did not take into account the structure of my HTML/JavaScript.  

My Instructor (Bryan), TA (Wilson), and Tutor (Chad) were all immensely helpful.  However, it is very apparent to me that there has been a shift in the method by which students are helped.  The help in prior weeks was to explain thoroughly and assist with the coding.  Now, it appears that there is a greater sense of focus on Google and figuring out code and concepts that we have not yet been exposed to.

## USAGE

Please be gentle with your grading of this quiz.  I spent around 20-25 hours on this assignment, but I was not able to execute all functionality.  This Star Wars themed quiz game is designed to ask 10 mutliple choice trivia questions in succession with a countdown timer and score that keeps track of correct answers.  The start button will initiate the quiz and timer, and the game is over when the timer reaches 0.  When the user clicks an answer button, the answer choice will be evaluated on click to determine if the answer is correct.  The user will be instantly notified on the selection of each question whether they are correct or incorrect.  For each correct answer, the user will receive +1 to score, and will receive +0 to score and a 5 sec penalty for an incorrect answer.  High scores will be saved and will be stored in local storage, so even if the user closes their browser, their high scores will be saved and presented when rerunning the game.

## AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
